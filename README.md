#play_dice
play_dice is a game that involves two players; player 1 and player 2. 
The goal of the game is to make the player who gets to a score of '100' first the winner. 
There are three major button functionalities, the 'Roll Dice', 'Hold' and 'New Game'. 
Clicking the 'Roll Dice' button rolls the dice and generates a random dice number which you can keep adding up in your current score till you otherwise roll a dice with 'number 1' and this switches to the other player and vice versa. 
Clicking the 'Hold' button helps saves your score and adds up each time you click it to your current score while at the same time automatically switches to the next player and vice versa. Whicheverplayers gets to a score of 100 first is declared winner. 
The 'New Game' button restarts the game.
